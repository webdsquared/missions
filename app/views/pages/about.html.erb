						<p>We are unlikely missionaries. But as we were approaching an empty nest, God began to take us on a journey of adventure and even deeper dependence on 	him. In January 2012, Bing badly broke his knee, spending several months unable to walk while recoving.</p>
						<p>With plenty of time to think and pray, and an 'accidental encounter' with a missionary during that time, we found our hearts being curiously drawn to 	cross-cultural ministry for the first time ever. After eight months of process with Mission To the World (MTW), we find ourselves fully approved and 	headed to the mission field.</p>
						<p>We have three fabulous, somewhat-grown children, who will not be moving to London with us. <strong>Will</strong>, age 24, graduated from the University of Tennessee this past Spring with a degree in Political Science and minor in German. <strong>Logan</strong>, age 23, graduated from New 	College Franklin, a small classical college, this past spring, and married his bride, Marley, thereafter. We also have <strong>Kate</strong>, age 19, who is a sophmore nursing student	at the University of Pennsylvania. Will and Kate have both spent time working in outreach ministry in London in the same part of the city in which we will most likely live. Logan can give a great literary-historical guided tour of London as well, so as you cam see, London is a place much-loved by us as a family.</p>
